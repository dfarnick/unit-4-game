# unit-4-game
This is a game created to entertain. 

You will be shown a value at the start. 
There are four "skulls" that have hidden values attached to each. 
As you click on the skulls it will add the value to your total. 
You win if you match the value shown to you at the start. 
However, if you go over that value you will lose. 
The game will reset when you win or lose.
You will be given a new value to guess. Also, the values attached to the skulls will change.
